1.4.0 - Codendi SOAP api 4.1 (Codendi_ST 4.0.16) Not released yet
    What Changed?
    ============
    * tracker addComment
        Add the field '--format' in order to specify the comment format (text/HTML)

    * frs addFile
        Send the file split in chunks so local files having big size can be added using CLI.
        For local file calculate md5sum of the file in client side then send it to the server so file integrity can be verified in server side.
        For uploaded file the user can submit the md5 of the file as a parameter for the same verification.
        Use SOAP addUploadedFile for both local and uploaded file since local file is created into incoming directory by addFile chunk.

    * frs getFile
        obtain the file split in chunks and reassamble it in client side,
        it verify also file integrity by comparing file md5sum calculted in client side with one obtained from the server.
