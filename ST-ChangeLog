Version 4.0.16 = Not released yet
        == New Features ==
        backlog #113540: Support of <pre> in tracker follow-up comment
                         * Follow-up comments can be submitted with usage of a subset
                           of HTML markups: p, br, a, img, ul, ol, li, cite, code, blockquote, strong, em, pre, b, i
                           This modification comes with a rich text editor in the  follow-up comment text area.
                           It's possible to add comment in HTML with SOAP and Codendi_CLI too (but no update yet).

                         * Fix wrong behaviour in CSV import/export that was leading to comments duplication.
                           Known limitations: It's not possible to import follow-up comments in HTML format yet.

                         * Improvement of Artifact edition UI: 
                           * reduce space "lost" between tracker's toolbar and artifact info.
                           * rework of follow-up comments layout to improve readability.
