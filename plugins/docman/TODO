* Delete Docman_ItemNode.class
* Make docman new item and update more coherent: since we already created and
  validated an Docman_Item object, DocmanActions should only rely on this
  object. (It imply to develop a validator for Docman_File).
* getItemMenu() in views make a lot of queries searchById (at least one per item!)
