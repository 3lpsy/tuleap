Tracker Email Gateway
=====================

Ability to update artifact by replying to notifications.

As of today this feature is not complete and should be manually installed/activated.

Installation
------------

> **Note:** Before doing these steps, please install, configure and use postfix

Add `nobody` in sudoers with visudo (yum install sudo if necessary). See `etc/sudoers.d/tuleap-plugin-tracker`.

You can now test (yum install mailx if necessary). Launch system check events and send an email:

    $root> echo 123 | mail -s "Mail from root" forge__artifacts

You should see debug traces in `/var/log/codendi/codendi_syslog`.

> **Note:** This assumes that your Tuleap is using legacy user/path (codendiadm,
> /usr/share/codendi, â€¦). You may need to adapt things to your setup.
