- login as root user
- cd into the directory where the codex_install.sh script is located
(probably /mnt/cdrom if you received the CodeX software on a CDROM)
- For a fresh CodeX installation run the installation script with ./codex_install.sh
- For an update from 3.2 please run migration_from_CodeX_3.2_to_CodeX_3.4.sh.
- For an update from a prior release, please update to CodeX 3.2 first.

This is CodeX 3.4.

Please read the README and INSTALL files carefully, and get in touch with us
at codex-contact@codex.xerox.com if you have questions.


What's new in CodeX 3.4?

- Eclipse Plugin: 
  CodeX users may now access their tasks and bugs directly from Eclipse!
  An Eclipse plugin is provided with CodeX 3.4. It allows full access to
  CodeX trackers: you may list, filter, edit and submit artifacts directly
  from the Eclipse IDE.
  This is implemented over the CodeX SOAP interface.


- Customize your personnal page and the project summary page with CodeX widgets.
  You may now select what information you want to display on your page, organize it,
  and even import external information through the new RSS reader.
  Project administrators may also customize the project summary page to display
  relevant information about the project.

- Artifact Edition improvement.
  The user interface of the artifact edition page has been improved. You may
  now edit, delete, point to, quote and sort follow-up comments. You can also
  fold/unfold the artifact details appropriately.
  

- CodeX Java Runtime Interface.
  Java developpers may now build CodeX extensions and tools with the CodeX JRI.
  The CodeX JRI is a java layer over the SOAP API that provides Java classes 
  to interact with the CodeX server. JARS and Javadoc are available.


- Many other improvements
  * SOAP API extended (mostly for tracker interaction)
  * New document manager features (obsolete documents, metadata, search and filtering)
  * various security fixes: password robustness tool, XSS fixes, htmlpurifier integration
  * template mechanism extended to all services
  * test projects
  * tracker: temporarily suspend email notifications
  * tracker: prevent fortuitous deletion of artifact data during concurrent update.
  * performance improvements: new_parse script, DB indexes
  * File packages may now be deleted
  * access logs export
  * Subversion upgraded to version 1.4.4
and many more smaller additions and fixes.

Enjoy CodeX!
