    <title>Communication Services</title>

    <para>One of the CodeX objectives is to provide developers with
    efficient software development and project management tools. In
    addition, the CodeX site should quickly become the favorite
    communication channel of all users as it is pivotal for the
    project teams and their community of users to communicate
    efficiently.</para>

    <para>To this end, CodeX offers a series of communication services that
    can be customized by the project team. These include mailing lists, the
    News service, the Web Forums and a Instant Messaging Plug-in.</para>

    <section id="MailingLists">
      <title>Mailing Lists</title>

      <section id="MailingListsCreation">
        <title>Creation</title>
        
      <para>Each project can create as many mailing lists (ML) as
      needed. To create a mailing list click on the &#34;Lists&#34;
      item in the Project Main menu, then click on the &#34;Admin&#34;
      link in the mailing list menu bar.</para>

      <para>Adding a ML is just a matter of giving it a name, a one-line
      description, and to specify whether it is a public or a private list. A
      private list won&#39;t show up on the welcome screen of the Mailing List
      service and is therefore only known to the project team. This will
      prevent other people from subscribing or posting messages to it.</para>

      <para>In order to minimize naming conflicts between the many MLs created
      by the various CodeX projects, the mailing list follows the following
      naming pattern:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
projectname-listname@&SYS_LISTS_HOST;
</programlisting>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                    spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para><literal>projectname</literal>
           is your project short name as defined during project
          registration.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><literal>listname</literal> is the name
          you have chosen for your mailing list.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <note><para>Creating a mailing list implies that you are the
      mailing list administrator, at least at the beginning. As the ML
      administrator, you&#39;ll receive some additional instructions via
      e-mail shortly after the creation of the ML. This is an important mail
      message that contains the URLs for the ML administration and information
      pages and the default ML administration password generated by CodeX.
      Keep it in a safe place!</para></note>

      <para><tip><title>Tip: Create at least one Mailing List</title><para>A
      CodeX hosted project should at least create one mailing list (or a web forum) where all
      users can post questions and comments. This list is typically called
      <literal>projectname-interest@&SYS_LISTS_HOST;</literal>. We
      strongly encourage you to follow this well established practice.</para></tip></para>
      </section>

      <section id="MailingListsAdministration">
        <title>Administration</title>

        <para>The ML administration is also entirely Web based. You can access
        the ML administration page by using the URL that you received when you
        first created the ML. In case you have misplaced the original message
        you can access the ML administration page at the following URL:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
http://&SYS_LISTS_HOST;/mailman/admin/listname
</programlisting>

        <para>The Administration page allows you to tune many ML parameters,
        manage list members, and administrators, privacy, new member welcome
        messages, etc. GNU/Mailman, the ML manager used by CodeX, is an extremely
        capable software and we invite you to visit the administration page at
        least once to get an idea about the feature set.</para>

        <note><para>Note that project administrators are not
        automatically made administrators of project mailing lists, and the
        administrative password for the mailing list is distinct from any of
        the other CodeX user passwords.</para></note>
      </section>

      <section id="UnSubscriptionArchiveandPreferences">
        <title>(Un)Subscription, Archive and Preferences</title>

        <para>Unless its owner marks a ML as private, any CodeX user can
        subscribe to a project Mailing List (ML). To subscribe to a mailing
        list click on the &#34;Lists&#34; item in the Project Main menu. From there click on the
        &#34;Subscribe/Unsubscribe/Preferences&#34; link of the appropriate
        ML. Then follow the instructions presented.</para>

        <para>The CodeX ML system (GNU/Mailman) also archives all the messages
        posted on a mailing list. Following the &#34;Archive&#34; link on the
        same page as before will bring you to archived messages grouped by
        month. Note that the current archiving software is not MIME-aware and
        does not support the archiving of attachments.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="NewsService">
      <title>News Service</title>

      <para>The News service complements your mailing lists. This service
      allows you to publish pieces of news related to your project. Any event
      in the life of your project is a good candidate for a news release: new
      people in the team, new software release, information on related
      technologies and why not your wedding announcement or the birth of your
      sixth child ? . Do not keep your project concealed behind a veil. Make
      your project life public for the benefit of all employees and for
      your faithful community of users.</para>

      <para>News publishing is very easy. Simply click on the &#34;News&#34;
      item in the Project Main menu and then on the &#34;Submit&#34; link in
      the News Service menu at the top of the page. From there type the title
      of the news and its text body. You can type URLs in the body. CodeX will
      detect them and transform them into a hyperlink in the published
      version. You can also choose whether you want the news to be public this means
      visible on your Project Summary page for all CodeX users or private 
      which means visible for your project members only.</para>

      <para>
      Any CodeX visitor can attach a follow-up comment to the news visible for
      her on your project page making each
      piece of news a potential forum of discussion<footnote><para>Behind the
      scene, each piece of news is actually managed exactly like a CodeX Web
      Forum.</para></footnote>. In addition the CodeX Team sees all the public news
      published by all CodeX projects and can decide that a project news is
      worth publishing on the CodeX front page. A big splash indeed!!
      When submitting a news, you can request a promotion for the CodeX front
      page to the administrator.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="WebForums">
      <title>Web Forums</title>

      <para>This is the third form of communication offered by CodeX. Web
      Forums are more or less equivalent to mailing list except that the
      message-posting takes place via a Web interface rather than email. Therefore you need to
      have a connection to the site to participate in the discussion because
      you can&#39;t prepare your message off-line, as you can with an ML.</para>

      <para>To access the Web Forums of a CodeX project, click on the
      &#34;Forums&#34; item in the Project Main menu. When a CodeX
      project is created, it is given three Web forums: Open
      Discussions, Help and Developers. These Forums and all others
      are open to all CodeX users both for reading and posting unless
      you decide to make them private (see below). A user can also
      decide to monitor a Web Forum. Monitoring a Forum will cause
      CodeX to automatically forward all the posted messages via e-
      mail thus avoiding repeated visits to the Forum Web page.</para>

      <para>Project administrators can create other Forums on demand by using
      the Forum Administration module that can be accessed via the
      &#34;Admin&#34; link in the News Service menu. Administrators can follow
      the links on this page to Add Forum, Delete Message, and Update Forum
      Info/Status. The Update Forum Info/Status page lets administrators make
      forums public or private, edit the name and description of the forum, or
      even delete the forum.</para>
    </section>
    
    <section id="IM">
        <title>Instant Messaging Plug-in</title>
        
        <para>CodeX is bundled with a Jabber server and an Instant Messaging (IM)
        Plug-In that allows a certain level of integration between them.</para>
        
        <para>If this plug-in is active, an IM account will be automatically
        available to each CodeX user and they will be able to log into the Jabber
        server using their CodeX credentials. Furthermore, users participating in
        a project will be grouped together in the Jabber server, whose will 
        automatically add this group to each of the participants' roster.</para>
        
        <para>For each project the plug-in will create a multi-user chat room (MUC)
        where the members of a project can chat together. Only members of a project
        can join its respective MUC, but once a member has joined the room he or she
        can invite external users.</para>
        
        <para>The CodeX IM plug-in does not come bundled with any Jabber client, 
        thus each user can choose the client that best fits his or her needs. Several
        open source (and/or free) clients are available for the most common platforms,
        and you can find a list (non-exhaustive) of them at http://www.jabber.org/clients.
        </para>
        
        <para>The status of a user using a Jabber client (online, busy, away) is 
        displayed in CodeX.</para>
        
        <section id="JabberClientConfiguration">
            <title>Jabber Client Configuration</title>
            
            <para>Configuring a Jabber client to use your CodeX account is 
            straightforward. In case you are using a multi protocol client the first 
            thing you need to do is setting the communication protocol to Jabber (or XMPP). 
            Three other pieces of information are essential for connecting to your Jabber 
            account: your username, your password, and the address of the Jabber server you 
            will connect to. Some Jabber clients refer to the JID (or Jabber ID) which is 
            simply your username and the Jabber server address connected by a @ sign 
            (eg. username@jabberhost.com), others ask explicitly for your username and the 
            Jabber server address. You can find your JID at your personal area on the CodeX 
            web page by logging into CodeX and clicking on the link “Account Maintenance” on 
            the tab  “My Personal Page”, or simply by accessing your “Developer Profile”. 
            There you can find your “Instant Messaging Login”, which is  formed by your CodeX 
            username and the CodeX Jabber server address. Use the same password you use to 
            sign in to your CodeX account.</para>
            
            <para>In addition to these parameters the client may ask you a name for 
            the resource you are using to connect to your Jabber account. This is handy 
            when you are connected to the same Jabber account through different devices 
            and so, for example, a message can be delivered to you@yourhost.com/pda instead 
            of you@yourhost.com/office (in this case “pda” and “office” are the resources).
            You can fill it with any alpha-numeric string.</para>
            
            <para>Finally, the client needs to know the port number the Jabber server 
            is listening to. The default value for this parameter is 5222, and most of 
            the Jabber clients use it by default.</para>
            
            <para>Some other “advanced” parameters can be configured, but it is out 
            of the scope of this guide to talk about them, so please refer to your Jabber 
            client documentation for further information on this topic.      
            </para>
            
        </section>
        <section id="JoiningAMUC">
            <title>Joining a Multi-User Chat Room (MUC)</title>
            <para>As stated before, the IM plug-in creates a multi-user chat
            room for each project. This room is named after the project name 
            and is opened only for project members.</para>
            
            <para>You need to inform your Jabber client the address of the conference
            server it must query for chat rooms. This address is simply 
            conference.server_address, i.e. the word “conference”, a dot, and the 
            Jabber server address. Then you will be able to retrieve the list of available
            chat rooms on the server. Just find the chat room corresponding to your project
            and join it.</para>
            
            <para>Of course the steps described above are very generic, and each 
            Jabber client has its own specific process. Please check your Jabber client 
            documentation for further information about its support on multi-user chat 
            (group chat, conferences, or simply chat rooms).</para>
            
            <para>Once inside the room you can invite non-members to join it.
            Once the user accepts the invitation he or she becomes member of
             the chat room.</para>
            
            <para>For further information on how to invite external users to chat
            rooms using your Jabber client please refer to its documentation.</para>
        </section>
        
        <section id="JabberOnCodexWebPage">
        <title>Jabber Related Information on the CodeX Web Page</title>
        
        <para>CodeX provides several bits of information regarding the Instant 
        Messaging on its web interface. Thus, each user has access to his roster 
        (contact list) and the status of each of his contacts directly on his personal page.
        In order to do this, simply visit the page "My Personal Page". If the widget 
        displaying the contact list is not visible it must be added. To do so, click on the 
        link "Add widgets" and add the widget corresponding to "My IM Roster".
        </para>
        
        <para>Next to each user name CodeX displays a colored icon (gray, green, yellow 
        or red) that indicates the status of the user: gray for "offline", green for "online",
        yellow for "away", and red for "busy". Users can change their status through their 
        Jabber client.</para>
        
        <para>Any new approved project implies the creation of a corresponding shared group
        and chat room.</para>
        
        <para>Any new member added to the project is also added to the corresponding shared
        group and chat room. This new member will be automatically invited to join the 
        project's chat room as soon as he or she connects to the Jabber server.</para>
        
        <para>If a member is removed from a project then he or she will also be removed 
        from its corresponding shared group and chat room.</para>
        
        <para>If a project is suspended or awaiting validation, its corresponding chat 
        room will be made unavailable (locked) and the shared group will not be visible on 
        the roster of project members.</para>
        
        <para>If a project is deleted, the corresponding chat room and shared group will 
        be destroyed as well.</para>
