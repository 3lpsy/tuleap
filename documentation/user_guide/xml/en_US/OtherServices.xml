      <title>Shell Account</title>

      <para>Each registered user receives its own Unix shell account on the
      CodeX Shell Account server. You can access your CodeX Shell Account in 2
      ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">SSH</emphasis>: the secured remote shell
          is the preferred way to connect to the CodeX Shell Account server.
          SSH clients are available for all platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix
          and Mac) and allows a secure link with your personal directories. It
          also provides you with a number of other useful utilities like scp
          for remote file transfer. To access your account connect type the
          following command and use your CodeX login and password to
          authenticate yourself:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
ssh -l loginname shell.codex.xerox.com
</programlisting>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Telnet</emphasis>: telnet comes standard
          with Windows and Unix environment. Use the following command to
          connect to the CodeX Shell Account server and provide your login and
          password as requested</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
telnet shell.codex.xerox.com
</programlisting>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><tip><title>** Important Remark **</title><para>The CodeX Team has
      established reasonable security measures on the CodeX shell server. By
      mapping the CodeX permission schema on the Linux permission schema, the
      data of a given project can only be manipulated by its project members.
      Any voluntary attempt to crack and/or damage other users or projects
      account will be considered as a gross misconduct and appropriate penalty
      will be applied. If you want to exercise your creativity in a useful way
      do not spend your time cracking CodeX, write clever code and contribute
      to CodeX instead !</para></tip></para>

      <para>Whether you use SSH or Telnet, a welcome banner will be displayed
      right after you log in. This message tells you what are the directories
      you are allowed to access. Use the Unix &#34;cd&#34; command to change
      the current working directory. Once logged in and if you are a member of
      several projects you must specify for which project you are going to
      work in this shell session. To this end use the following command:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
newgrp projectname
</programlisting>

      <para>You can use this command as many time as you want during a shell
      session when you are about to do work for another one of your project.</para>

    <section id="FTPStorageSpaces">
      <title>FTP Storage Spaces</title>

      <para>Each project receives its own FTP storage which is made of 2
      distinct zones. The Anonymous FTP Space and the File Release FTP space.</para>

      <section id="TheAnonymousFTPSpace ">
        <title>The Anonymous FTP Space</title>

        <para>The anonymous FTP space can be used by the project members to
        upload any kind of documents or project data and deliverables they
        want. It can be accessed by making an ftp connection to
        <literal><emphasis>projectname</emphasis>.codex.xerox.com</literal>.
        Anonymous users (login &#34;ftp&#34;) are granted read-only access
        whereas project members using their CodeX login and password will be
        granted read (download) and write (upload) access to this FTP area.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="TheFileReleaseFTPSpace ">
        <title>The File Release FTP Space</title>

        <para>This is where CodeX stores the new file releases uploaded and
        registered through the CodeX File Release service (see <xref
        linkend="FileRelease" />). Access is granted to project members only
        in case they want to make modifications by hand. <emphasis role="bold">We
        highly recommend you do not touch this space since it is entirely
        managed through the CodeX Web interface</emphasis>. If you have
        questions about your file releases please contact the CodeX Team.</para>

        <para>Project members can access this ftp space as follows:</para>

        <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                      spacing="compact">
          <listitem>
            <para>Via your shell account (SSH or Telnet to <literal>shell.codex.xerox.com</literal>).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Via ftp by connecting to <literal>download.codex.xerox.com</literal>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>In both cases use your CodeX login/password to login and type
        the following command to go to the FTP Release Space directory:</para>

<programlisting format="linespecific" linenumbering="unnumbered" width="80">
cd /home/ftp/codex/projectname

          <para>The FTP incoming space where you can directly drag and drop
          your file releases instead of using FTP upload (See <xref
          linkend="ReleaseConfigurationandValidation" />)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><tip><title>**IMPORTANT REMARK**</title><para>If you registered as
      a CodeX user before this feature was enabled (on September 4th, 2001)
      you must enter your password again in CodeX before you can access the
      shared resources. To do so first login on CodeX and go to <ulink
      url="http://codex.xerox.com/account/change_pw.php">http://codex.xerox.com/account/change_pw.php</ulink>.
      Then re-type your current password in old and new fields. Click on the
      Update button and wait for the re-generation to happen (delay shown on
      the screen).</para></tip></para>

      <para>To access your CodeX shared resources, open Windows Explorer,
      browse the Entire Microsoft Network, open the WCRT domain and click on
      the CodeX machine. Use your CodeX login and password to connect to the
      resources (If they are not the same as your Windows login/password a
      dialog box will pop up asking for the appropriate CodeX login/password)</para>

      <para>Shared resources can also be directly accessed at:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
                    spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para><literal>\\codex\your_login_name</literal> (User home
          directory - for all users)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><literal>\\codex\Projects</literal> (All project directories -
          for project members)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><literal>\\codex\Ftp_Incoming</literal> (FTP upload space -
          for project members)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Needless to say all read and write permissions put in place by
      CodeX to protect your data still apply to these shared resources.</para>
