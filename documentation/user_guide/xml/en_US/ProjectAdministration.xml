    <title>Project Administration</title>

    <para>Whenever you enter the Project Summary page of a given project or
    any of its service you&#39;ll see a new section appear in the CodeX Main
    Menu on the left hand side of the screen. This new section relates to the
    visited project and points to the Project Summary page and the Project
    Administration page.</para>

    <para>Only project members can access the Project Administration page. All
    other CodeX users are denied access to this part of a project.</para>

    <section id="ProjectAdministrationMenu">
      <title>Project Administration Menu</title>

      <para>In addition to the CodeX Main Menu that was introduced in the
      description of the Project Summary page, the Project Administration page
      has its own menu. This menu is not redundant with the page content right
      below. Except for 1 or 2 items the menu and the page content give access
      to distinct parts of the administration space. So pay attention to both
      the Page Admin menu and the Page Admin content. In the following
      sections the Location label indicates where to find the corresponding
      administrative function.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="AddingRemovingUsers">
      <title>Adding/Removing Users</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Page Admin Content</emphasis></para>

      <para>User administration in CodeX is easy. To add a new member to a
      project team one of the project administrator just has to type the login
      name of the invited member and click on the &#34;Add User&#34; button.
      If you don&#39;t know the login name of the new project member you want
      to add, open a new browser window on CodeX and use the search box in the
      CodeX Main Menu to search for the person&#39;s real name (first or last
      name or both) and don&#39;t forget to select &#34;People&#34; in the
      Search pull-down menu. The result list will show you the user real name
      and login name.</para>

      <para>Removing a project member is even easier. Just click on the trash
      icon (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG"
      fileref="../../icons/trash.png" /></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>) next
      to the person&#39;s name to revoke his/her membership. Revoking
      membership has absolutely no effect on the history and the data
      integrity of the project. In other words all bugs, tasks, support
      requests, ... assigned or submitted by this person will continue to show
      up as before in the project database. Only the ability of this person to
      perform project management tasks is affected. Also notice that in order
      to remove a project administrator from the project member list, another
      project administrator must first change the &#34;Project Admin&#34; flag
      of this user to &#34;No&#34; in the User Permission table. In other
      words, a Project Administrator cannot be removed from the project
      members as long as she has administrator privilege.</para>

      <para></para>
      <para><note>You have probably noticed that project member&#39;s
      name on the Project Administration page are actually hyperlinks. On this
      page as well as in many other pages throughout CodeX a click on a login
      name leads you to the user page where you can know more about the user
      (including its location, phone/fax number, etc. extracted from the Xerox
      Directory in real time) and send an e-mail message to this person
      directly via a Web form.</note></para>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Page Admin Content</emphasis></para>

      <para>Project Administrators have the ability to grant different
      permissions to different users. As an example, a project member can be
      granted full administration rights on the Bug Tracking System and no
      rights at all on the Documentation Manager of the project.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">The Project Home Page</emphasis>: each
          project hosted on CodeX has its own virtual Web server available on
          the CodeX site. By default the &#34;Home Page&#34; in the Project
          Main Menu points to this location (see CHAPTER 16 for more details).
          If you want the Home Page of your project to point to some other
          locations on the Xerox Intranet (or even outside of Xerox) replace
          the default value with your own Web location. Do not confuse your
          Project Home Page with your Project Summary page. The Project Home
          Page actually points to real Web Site whereas the Public Summary

    <section id="ProjectDataExport">
      <title>Project Data Export</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>CodeX is very appealing to many project development teams because
      it provides full-featured project development and management tools for
      free. A software project can be managed almost entirely from within
      CodeX. However at some point the project team needs to report about
      progress made, what goes well or wrong, how far you are from the end
      date, derive statistical data, etc.</para>

      <para>It is far beyond the scope of CodeX to provide project teams with
      such reporting tools. There are many specialized tools on the market to
      generate progress reports and each project team has its favorite one. In
      order to satisfy this diversity of needs, the CodeX Team has developed a
      very efficient system that allows the project team to export the project
      data outside of CodeX for re-use in other tools like Access, Excel,
      Crystal Report, Word or any other ad-hoc tools.</para>

      <para>CodeX provides you with 2 kinds of Data Export:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Text File Export</emphasis>: these are
          bugs and tasks data extracted from the project database and exported
          in text format. The text format used is called CSV (Comma Separated
          Values) and is recognized by almost every Office or database tool on
          the market</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Direct Database Connection</emphasis>:
          so to speak this not a Data Export. It is rather a direct connection
          to your project database through an ODBC or JDBC driver. If you want
          to manipulate your project data with a database tool (like
          MS-Access) this is certainly the best choice.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Full documentation on how to use and configure the Data Export
      Facility is available on the CodeX Site Documentation (<ulink
      url="http://codex.xerox.com/docs/site/">http://codex.xerox.com/docs/site/</ulink>
      ) under the title <emphasis>&#34;Extracting your Project Data from

      <title>Edit/Release Files</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu and Page Admin
      Content</emphasis></para>

      <para>This service allows project members to post packaged versions (zip
      or tar gzipped ) of their software on CodeX for public consumption. All
      posted file releases can be accessed from the Project Summary page.</para>

      <para>Chapter <xref linkend="FileRelease" /> is entirely dedicated to
      the description of the File Release Service.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="Post-EditJobs">
      <title>Post/Edit Jobs</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>CodeX offers a minimal job posting system to your project. When
      you publish a job it instantly appears under the &#34;Project Help
      Wanted&#34; section on the CodeX Main Menu and is visible to all CodeX
      users including those who are not registered users. It is an excellent
      way of calling for help either on a specific topic or to sub-contract a
      part of your work.</para>

      <important>
        <title>Important Note on Job Posting</title>

        <para>It is not the intent of the CodeX Job Posting system to replace
        PeopleNet or any other countrywide job posting system already in place
        in Xerox. The CodeX Job Posting system is intended to call for
        expertise or short mission request. One of the possible uses of the
        CodeX Job Posting system is for Projects to post 3 to 6 months jobs
        that can be sub-contracted to organizations like XConnect or XISS/XPS.
        It can also be a request for the opinion of an expert that would take
        no longer than a couple of days even a couple of hours.</para>

      <title>Source Code Access Logs</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>CodeX is about Software Sharing inside Xerox. Our goal is to make
      software re-use part of the Xerox culture. To this end, Source code
      access and file release download is granted to all registered users
      <footnote><para>Anonymous users are not granted access to the Source
      code. They must create their own account and identify themselves with
      CodeX before they can do so.</para></footnote> on CodeX. Beside that we
      also wanted the ability for project leaders to see who downloaded their
      software. The CodeX Team implemented this feature upon request of
      several project administrators shortly after the site was launched. The
      intent for the project leaders is not to construct barriers to source
      code sharing but rather to know who their community of users are and who
      is interested in their software.</para>

      <para>The Source Code Access Logs provide project members with 2 lists:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para>The first list is about File Release download. It basically
          reports who (Real Name, Login name and e-mail), downloaded what file
          and when (date and time). The time of download is reported in local
          time relative to the project member time zone.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The second list is about CodeX users who used CVS to checkout
