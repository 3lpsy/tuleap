    <title>Project Administration</title>

    <para>Whenever you enter the Project Summary page of a given project or
    any of its service you&#39;ll see a new section appear in the CodeX Main
    Menu on the left hand side of the screen. This new section relates to the
    visited project and points to the Project Summary page and the Project
    Administration page.</para>

    <para>Only project members can access the Project Administration page. All
    other CodeX users are denied access to this part of a project.</para>

    <section id="ProjectAdministrationMenu">
      <title>Project Administration Menu</title>

      <para>In addition to the CodeX Main Menu that was introduced in the
      description of the Project Summary page, the Project Administration page
      has its own menu. This menu is not redundant with the page content right
      below. Except for 1 or 2 items the menu and the page content give access
      to distinct parts of the administration space. So pay attention to both
      the Page Admin menu and the Page Admin content. In the following
      sections the Location label indicates where to find the corresponding
      administrative function.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="AddingRemovingUsers">
      <title>Adding/Removing Users</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Page Admin Content</emphasis></para>

      <para>User administration in CodeX is easy. To add a new member to a
      project team one of the project administrator just has to type the login
      name of the invited member and click on the &#34;Add User&#34; button.
      If you don&#39;t know the login name of the new project member you want
      to add, open a new browser window on CodeX and use the search box in the
      CodeX Main Menu to search for the person&#39;s real name (first or last
      name or both) and don&#39;t forget to select &#34;People&#34; in the
      Search pull-down menu. The result list will show you the user real name
      and login name.</para>

      <para>Removing a project member is even easier. Just click on the trash
      icon (<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG"
      fileref="../../icons/trash.png" /></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>) next
      to the person&#39;s name to revoke his/her membership. Revoking
      membership has absolutely no effect on the history and the data
      integrity of the project. In other words all bugs, tasks, support
      requests, ... assigned or submitted by this person will continue to show
      up as before in the project database. Only the ability of this person to
      perform project management tasks is affected. Also notice that in order
      to remove a project administrator from the project member list, another
      project administrator must first change the &#34;Project Admin&#34; flag
      of this user to &#34;No&#34; in the User Permission table. In other
      words, a Project Administrator cannot be removed from the project
      members as long as she has administrator privilege.</para>

      <note><para>You have probably noticed that project member&#39;s
      name on the Project Administration page are actually hyperlinks. On this
      page as well as in many other pages throughout CodeX a click on a login
      name leads you to the user page where you can know more about the user
      (including its location, phone/fax number, etc. extracted from the LDAP 
      Directory in real time) and send an e-mail message to this person
      directly via a Web form.</para></note>

      <para>Project Administrators have the ability to grant different
      permissions to different users. As an example, a project member can be
      granted full administration rights on the Bug Tracking System and no
      rights at all on the Documentation Manager of the project.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="ProjectDataExport">
      <title>Project Data Export</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>CodeX is very appealing to many project development teams because
      it provides full-featured project development and management tools for
      free. A software project can be managed almost entirely from within
      CodeX. However at some point the project team needs to report about
      progress made, what goes well or wrong, how far you are from the end
      date, derive statistical data, etc.</para>

      <para>It is far beyond the scope of CodeX to provide project
      teams with such reporting tools. There are many specialized
      tools on the market to generate progress reports and each
      project team has its favorite one. In order to satisfy this
      diversity of needs, the CodeX Team has developed a very
      efficient system that allows the project team to export the
      project data outside of CodeX for re-use in other tools like
      Access, Excel, Crystal Report, Word, Open Office, Star Office or
      any other ad-hoc tools.</para>

      <para>CodeX provides you with 2 kinds of Data Export:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Text File Export</emphasis>:
          this is a simple text extract of your project data. It uses
          the well known CSV (Comma Separated Value) format. CSV is
          recognized by almost every Office Suite or database tool on
          the market. In case you want to develop your own report
          application most programming languages also come with a
          standard library that knows how to parse CSV format. </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Direct Database
          Connection</emphasis>: so to speak this is not a Data
          Export. It is rather a direct connection to your project
          database through an ODBC or JDBC driver. If you want to
          manipulate your project data with a database tool (like
          MS-Access or an ODBC/JDBC application) this is certainly the
          best choice.</para>

      <title>Service Configuration</title>

      <para><emphasis>Location: Project Administration Menu</emphasis></para>

      <para>The &#34;Service Configuration&#34; item of the Project Administration
      menu lists all services available to the project. Services are items listed 
      in the  &#34;Service Bar &#34; on top of each page: trackers, patch manager,
      document manager, CVS, homepage, documentation, etc. 
      The Service Configuration page allows a project 
      administrator to update, enable, disable or even create services.
      </para>

      <para>There are two kinds of services:</para>
 
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">System services</emphasis>:
          these services are defined by the site administrator and are common to
          all projects. They cannot be modified, except for their status 
          (enabled/disabled) and their position on the screen (see below).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Project services</emphasis>: 
          these services can be fully customized or deleted by the project administrator.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>There is one exception, the
          <emphasis role="bold">Home Page</emphasis> service is a
          system service but it can be customized with any URL. Each
          project hosted on CodeX has its own virtual Web server available on
          the CodeX site. By default the &#34;Home Page&#34; in the Project
          Service Bar links to this location (see CHAPTER 16 for more details).
          If you want the Home Page of your project to link to some other
          locations on the Intranet or on the Web, simply replace
          the default value with your own Web location. Do not confuse your
          Project Home Page with your Project Summary page. The Project Home
          Page actually points to real Web Site whereas the Public Summary
          Page is just an entry point to access software related activities
          and deliverables.</para>


    <section id="ServiceCreation">

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Service Link</emphasis>:
          This is the URL of the service, i.e. the address the user will be 
          redirected to when clicking on the service label in the Service Bar.
          If the URL is absolute (i.e. starting with &#34;http://&#34;), the page
          will be loaded in a new window. Otherwise, it will be loaded in the 
          current window.

          Toggling this select box will simply disable (or enable)

          means that it no longer appears in the Service Bar and in the  
          Project Summary page of your
          project but all existing data related to this service remains
          untouched. In other words, re-enabling the service will restore
          the service in the exact same state it was when you first
          disabled it. See also &#34;Deleting a Service&#34; below.

	    good idea to use values like 10,20,30,... so that it is

            <emphasis role="bold">project_members, project_admins, registered_users, nobody,
            file_manager_admin</emphasis>, etc. These groups are dynamic: if you assign some

        <step>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Custom User Groups</emphasis> are defined by project
            administrators. They are composed of a static list of users. The only requirement
            is that any member must be a registered CodeX user. This list can be modified at
            any time, but will not automatically be updated, except if a member is removed from

        <title>Tip: Combining pre-defined groups with additional members?</title>

        <para>Sometimes, you might want to grant some permissions to all project members and some 
        other CodeX users.
        In this case, you might be tempted to build a user group from the list of project members and
        to add the other users to the group.
        The issue with this solution is that if new members join the project, they will have to be
        manually added to the group. So it is more convenient to create a group containing only the
        users that are not member of the project. And then, permissions should be granted to this group
        and to the pre-defined "project members" group. 
        </para>
