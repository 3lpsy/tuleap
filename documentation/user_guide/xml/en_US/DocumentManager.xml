  <title>Document Manager</title>

  <para>Documentation is probably the second most important deliverable in a
    software project after the software work products themselves. CodeX
    provides a specific service to manage your project documents.</para>

  <para>The CodeX Document Manager is very basic and cannot compare
    in any way with specialized document repository like DocuShare. It
    is however very handy to publish documents that are critical to
    your community of users. Examples are: Installation, Adminstration
    or User Guide, API documentation, Frequently Asked Questions,
    etc...</para>

  <para>The Document Manager features are as follows:</para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
		spacing="compact">
    <listitem>
      <para>The CodeX Document Manager can handle any type of
      document. However we strongly encourage editors to publish their
      documents in HTML and/or PDF to make it readable quickly and
      easily.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Documents are stored in groups (or folders). The folders are
        only one level deep which means you can&#39;t have subfolders in a
        folder.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Documents can be edited on line (if in text or HTML format).</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Access control rules can be defined for each document or document group.</para>
    </listitem>

  </itemizedlist>

  <section id="DocumentBrowsing">
    <title>Document Browsing</title>

    <para>To access the Document Manager select the &#34;Docs&#34; item from
      the Project Menu at the top of the screen of the Project Summary page.
      The welcome page of the Document Manager shows the list of all the
      documents published by the project by group.</para>

    <para>To read a document simply click on the title.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="DocumentSubmission">
    <title>Document Submission</title>

    <para>Only project members with the 'Technician' role in the 'User Permissions'
      matrix can submit documentation.  To submit a new document, click on the
      &#34;Submit New Documentation&#34; link in the Document Manager menu 
      (<xref linkend="FigureASampleDocumentManagerWelcome" />). Then provide the
      Document Title, the document description and the body of the text.</para>

    <para>The document itself can either be copy-pasted directly in the
      document text area or uploaded with the help of the &#34;Browse&#34;
      button and the &#34;Upload&#34; checkbox. Then select a document group
      from the pull-down menu and click on the &#34;Submit Information&#34;
      button.</para>

    <para>A document has to be attached to a group in any case. This is why
      CodeX provides a default group called 'Documents' to each project. 
      This default group may renamed without any problem.</para>

    <para><tip><title>Tip: Copy-pasted vs. uploaded documents</title>
    <para>A copy-pasted document will be embedded in a CodeX page, so its 
      appearance will be modified, and some tags like HTML, TITLE, or HEAD
      will be ignored. An uploaded document, on the opposite, will be displayed
      "as-is" in the browser window. Another difference is that a copy-pasted
      document can be edited online, whereas an uploaded document can only be 
      updated by uploading a new version.</para>
    </tip></para>

    <para>The document title and summary can contain HTML tags. So you can
      use all sorts of typographic effects as well as pointers to other
      locations, etc.</para>

    <para><tip><title>Tip: Referencing external documents</title>
    <para>It is sometime convenient to create placeholder documents
    that actually point to an external location like a DocuShare
    collection or a DocuShare file for instance. To do this, simply
    surround the document title with an HREF tag (hyperlink) pointing
    to the real location elsewhere on the Intranet (an example
    is given with Document #15 in <xref
    linkend="FigureTheDocumentManagerAdministrationScreen" />)</para>
    </tip></para>

  </section>

  <section id="DocumentAdministration">
    <title>Document Administration</title>

    <para>The Document Manager provides a number of administration functions
      like changing a document access permissions, display position or group,
      creating new document groups, etc.</para>

    <section id="DocumentPublication">
      <title>Document Publication</title>

      <para>Once a new document has been submitted by a project
      member with 'Technician' rights on the Document Manager, it
      is immediately visible on the Document Manager welcome page</para>

    </section>

    <section id="DocumentUpdate">
      <title>Document Update</title>

      <para>Only members with the 'Administration' right on the
      Document Manager can modify an existing document.</para>

      <para>You can update a document in several ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet"
		    spacing="compact">
	<listitem>
	  <para>The title, description and document body can be modified. In
            this case you update the document content</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>You can change the group (or folder) a document belong to</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>You can change the document display rank in the document group</para>
	</listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To update a document click on the &#34;Admin&#34; link in the
        Document Manager menu (<xref linkend="FigureASampleDocumentManagerWelcome" />).
        What you see next is the list of all documents of the project sorted
        by group and by rank. Then choose the
        document you want to update from the list. Click on the document title
        to make the document update screen appear. From here you can modify
        any part of the document, its rank, and the group it belongs to.</para>

    </section>

    <section id="DocumentGroupManagement">
      <title>Document Group Management</title>

      <para>In the CodeX Terminology, a CodeX Document group is
      equivalent to a folder.</para>

	</mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>To create, delete or change the name of document groups, click
        on the &#34;Admin&#34; link in the Document Manager menu (<xref
        linkend="FigureASampleDocumentManagerWelcome" />) and then the
        &#34;Edit Document Groups&#34; item in the next menu.</para>

      <para>To add a new group, use the &#34;Group Name&#34; and &#34;Rank&#34; text fields
        at the top of the screen and click on the &#34;Create&#34; button. You
        can also update an existing group by clicking on its name in the group list.</para>

      <para>Document groups have a display rank property that defines
      how document groups are ordered. Document groups with smaller ranks 
      are displayed first.</para>

      <para>Access permissions can be defined by clicking on the [Define Permissions] link.</para>
      <para>Document groups can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon in the group list. 
      Only empty document groups may be deleted: move or delete documents that belong to a group before trying to delete it.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section id="DocAccessPermissions">
      <title>Setting Access Permissions</title>
      
      <para>Setting document access permissions is very similar to setting file access 
       permissions (<xref linkend="FileAccessPermissions" />): you need to create
       user groups, and assign those user groups to documents or document groups.</para>

      <para>By default, document and document groups have no specific access permissions: access
        to all documents is granted to anybody, including anonymous user.
        However, in some cases, you might want to limit the users allowed to read your
        documentation, e.g. when it contains confidential data.
        In these specific cases, you can restrict access permissions to your documents
        to specific user groups. See <xref linkend="UserGroups" /> for more
        information on user groups.
      </para>
      <para>Document groups and document permissions are enforced at two different levels:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Document List:</emphasis> When a user is not granted
          access to a document, then it is not listed in the 'Docs'
          main page, so s/he does not know that the document exists.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Display:</emphasis> If a user finds or forges a display 
          link for an unauthorized document, the download will still fail. The system systematically re-checks
          for permissions when documents are requested for download.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Access permissions can be defined at two different levels: document groups and documents:</para>

      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Document Group Permissions</emphasis></para>
          <para>By clicking on 'Define Permissions' on the "Edit Document Groups" screen 
            (see <xref linkend="FigureTheDocumentGroupsAdministrationScreen" />),
            a project member with the 'Document Manager Admin' right (see <xref linkend="UserPermissions" />)
            can attach access permissions to any existing document group.</para>
          <para>The document group permissions edition page
            lists all the project user groups. Simply select the user groups that will be allowed 
            to display documents from the document group and press submit. You may select several groups at
            the same time if needed. If you press 'Reset To Defaults', the access permissions to this
            package will be reset, so any user will be able to download it.
          </para>
          <para>Note that each time you edit permissions associated to a document group, the previous values are
            reset. So, for instance, if you grant permissions to 'project members', submit, then want to
            grant permissions to another group, do not forget to select also 'project members' the second
            time, or they will not have access to your document group.</para>
          <para>Permissions attached to a document group apply to all documents that belong to this group.
            But you may also set different permissions to specific documents (see below).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Document permissions</emphasis></para>
          <para>If you need finer grained access control to your documents, you can also define permissions
            at the document level.</para>
          <para>The procedure is similar to the document group permissions definition. Simply click on 'Define Permissions'
            on the document manager 'admin' page (see <xref linkend="FigureTheDocumentManagerAdministrationScreen" />) to attach 
            access permissions to a document. Then select allowed user groups and submit.</para>
          <para>If you do not specify any access permissions for a document (or reset them to default), it inherits 
            the access permissions from the document group it belongs to. However, when you define a permission for a document,
            then it overrides the permissions defined for the group.</para>
          <para>The permissions set for the document can be either stricter or less strict than the group permissions.
          </para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para><tip><title>Tip: Updating existing permissions</title>
        <para>There is a shortcut to update document and document group permissions. For project
        administrators or document manager administrators, the main 'Docs' page displays small lock icons
        next to protected documents and groups. Simply click on the lock to update permissions
        for the corresponding object.
