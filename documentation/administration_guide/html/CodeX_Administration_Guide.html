<h1>Administration Tasks</h1>
To access the CodeX Administration interface you must use an account
with administration privileges. When CodeX is first installed a
privileged account named <span style="font-weight: bold;">'</span>admin<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'</span>
is created with the default password 'siteadmin'. One of the first
thing you must do is to login as 'admin' and change the password for
security reasons.<br>
<br>
Note that any normal user accounts can also be granted site
administration privileges by her a member of the project id #1,
the CodeX Administration project, and giving her the status of
administrator on this project.<br>
<br>
<center><b><font color="#ff0000">** IMPORTANT REMARK **</font></b></center>
<font color="#ff0000">When you use a CodeX account with administration
privileges, remember to <b>log out</b> after each work session
especially </font><font color="#ff0000">if you work an a desktop
computer other than yours or if you share a computer with other people</font>
<h2> Pending projects</h2>
Before a CodeX hosted project is made available to the project team, it
must
be reviewed and approved by the CodeX administration team. New projects
must be checked for approval on a regular basis so that the submitter
doesn't wait too
long
before they get the confirmation. When a project is submitted an email
notification is sent to the CodeX administrators (see the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$sys_email_admin</span> variable in
the CodeX configuration file) allowing for a quick response time. In
general it is recommended that you approve all projects.
There most noticeable exceptions are:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Little pieces of code</b></li>
If the submitted project looks like it is going to post small pieces of
code
like a macro or a function or a simple script, the administrator
reviewing
the project submission must contact the project creator and suggest
that the CodeX Snippet
Library might be a better place to host such a small piece of code.<br>
&nbsp; <li> <b>Yet Another Test Project<br>
    </b>The second case is when the team is saying they are creating a
file for
testing&nbsp;
purposes. In order to avoid the proliferation of test projects some
generic
purpose test projects have been created. In this case the project
creator
must be contacted and the admin must suggest that we make him/her a
member
of the Guinea Pig test project with full admin rights so that s/he can
test
all the CodeX feature and make a conscious decision. If it is ok then
we
do approve the project.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Similar projects exist<br>
    </b></li>
As a site administrator, you'll have the opportunity to review all the
projects created on CodeX and, therefore, you have a unique opportunity
to advise project leaders about existing projects looking like the one
you are about to approve. This might be a chance for the project
submitter to learn about another CodeX project that does more or less
what s/he wants and, rather than created a new project, it may be more
appropriate to join the existing team and contribute to the other
project.<br>
  <br>
</ol>
<font color="#ff0000"></font>
<h2> Site News Approval</h2>
All news published by each project (using the News service) is normally
only
visible on the related Project Summary page. The CodeX Administration
team has the
ability
to review all pieces of news published over the last 7 days by the
various
projects and make the decision to promote any piece of news so that it
appears
on the CodeX front page. If you decide a news is worth a big
splash on
the front page then select "Approve for front page", make modifications
in
the news title or content to make it more explicit and validate. If not
interesting
then you can delete the news front the approval queue (it is not
deleted from the project news database of course!)
<p>Rules to follow to determine whether a piece of news is worth
publishing on
the
front page: </p>
<ul>
  <li> All news dealing with new software releases and other
significant
events
in the life of the projects (new members,...) should be promoted on the
front
page</li>
  <li>The same applies for news announcing the creation of a new
project. However the CodeX front page already has a section
automatically showing the most recent projects and you may decide not
to publish new project announcement.<br>
  </li>
  <li> If a project publishes 2 or 3 pieces of news at the same time,
then
select the most significant one and only publish this one. When the
CodeX visitors click on this particular piece of news they will be
redirected to the project pages and they get a chance to read the other
news.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2> Account Management</h2>
CodeX is a self managed system and there is normally no
need
to spend time on user account maintenance. There are a couple of
exceptions
though:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Lost password</b>: some user sometimes ask for their lost
password.
Direct them to the CodeX login screen and ask them to click on the
'Lost Password' link.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Lost login</b>: some users even lose their login name :-)
Tell
them to use the CodeX search box, select the People item and type a
part of
their last name (it's very unlikely that they also forgot about their
last name...). The login should appear in the result list and they
can
then follow the lost password procedure as explained before.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Lost password and e-mail address has changed</b>: in this
case
the normal recovery procedure won't work because the user will never
receive
the e-mail notification (given that his/her email address is wrong).
The CodeX Admininstrator must use the User Admininstration module,
update
the
e-mail address of the user&nbsp; and then tell the user to proceed as
in the lost password procedure.</li>
  <li> <b>E-mail address is no longer valid</b>: this is something
that is often seen when using the CodeX mass mail Engine. All invalid
e-mail address are
bounced
and returned to codex-admin@codex.xerox.com. Once in a while it is good
to
make a bit of clean-up in the user database as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Look for the person name in your enterprise directory. If
this
person is still working for the company and his/her e-mail address has
changed then contact the user and
ask him/her to update the address.</li>
    <li> If the person is no longer with your company, go to the CodeX
User
Admininstration page, spot the user login name and click either on
'Suspend' or 'Delete' link for this account.&nbsp; Opting for account
suspension gives a chance to the user to complain that she is still
alive and we can easily reactivate the account without loosing personal
information.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li> <b>Incorrect e-mail given at registration time:</b> amazingly
enough this is
quite
a common mistake for new user to mistype their email address on the
user registration form. In this case, the email notification sent to
the user for confirmation never reaches the recipient and the user
account cannot be validated . Upon reception of the bounced email
notification, the CodeX Administrators have two options:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>access the CodeX main administration page, look for pending
user account, force the approval of the user account and send a note to
the user saying that the account is now active and the first she must
do is to change her email address under the 'Account Maintenance' link</li>
    <li>or the CodeX Administrator can simply send the bounced message
to the appropriate email address, ask the user to confirm his
registration and change her email address as above.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> <b>Alien e-mail addresses</b>: when a user registers we
strongly recommend
that they use internal and approved e-mail address only. Ideally the
user should also use the canonical form of her email address type it
is
it appears in your company directory. By doing so, CodeX lookups in
your
company directory will work correctly. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2> Site News Push</h2>
CodeX offers a mass mail engine to the CodeX Administration Team
makeing it possible to push an announcement to a all or part of your
CodeX population. Be careful that it's ideal for
spamming
so use it with caution and only when needed (see below). The mass mail
engine allows you to select your target population, type a
message and send it with a click of a mouse. Use this mechanism to push
site
update news like:
<ul>
  <li> A new CodeX document is published: CodeX newsletter, CodeX
article, new
CodeX
User Guide,...</li>
  <li> New major features available in CodeX</li>
  <li> Maintenance operation: hardware or sofware upgrade&nbsp; and
all
the
events that will prevent the CodeX server from operating normally must
be
announced ahead of time</li>
  <li> Disaster reports: typical examples are network problems due
to
router flapping or wide area network cut due.&nbsp; CodeX has nothing
to do with this kind of
troubles
but we must inform the user that they'll probably experience some
difficulties
to reach the CodeX server</li>
</ul>
<b><font color="#ff0000">Remark:</font></b> when a mass mail message is
eent the CodeX Administration team may receive
many copies
of it. This is due to the fact that messages are sent
by
chunk of 25 addresses and CodeX administrators receive a copy for each
chunk. So the
larger
the selected population the bigger the number of copies. The reason for
these multiple copies is because messages are "apparently" sent to
noreply@codex.xerox.com to stress the fact that recipient should not
reply to this message. If the noreply email address is an alias to
codex-admin then multiple copies will be received by CodeX
administrators. The noreply address may also be aliased to&nbsp;
/dev/null to avoid this problem (see <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/aliases</span>).
<p> </p>
<h2> Developer Survey </h2>
<p>
The <b>Developer Survey</b> is a special survey that appears in the
user's&nbsp; personal page.&nbsp; The developer is a general survey
that gives site administrators the opportunity
to better understand the
population of users (e.g. how they heared about CodeX, do they like it,
etc.).
This survey can only be answered once. The Developer Survey is
automatically created at&nbsp; CodeX installation
time (survey id 1, associated to project 1), but it is inactive by
default and
does not contain any question.<br>

<h1> CodeX File Permissions</h1>
The CodeX Web interface use the paradigm of project and project members
to
manage access permissions to the various project data. CodeX
maintains
this access permission policy both at the Web and Unix levels.
Therefore CodeX makes
a
direct mapping between a project and a Linux group, and between a user
and
a Linux account. As an example if you are a member of the "codex"
project on
CodeX, your Unix account will also be a member of the "codex" Unix
group.
<p>&nbsp;Let's review some of the key permission mechanism in place on
CodeX.
More information on the subject can be found in the CodeX User Guide<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2> User accounts</h2>
When a new user registers on CodeX three accounts are created:
<ol>
  <li> <b>A Web account</b> managed by the login/session mechanism
implemented
in PHP:</li>
  <br>
Information about login name and encrypted password arestored in the
CodeX database.<br>
&nbsp; <li> <b>A Unix account</b> with the same name/password as the
Web
account</li>
  <br>
This account is used for shell account and to setup the ownership on
appropriate
directories.
Information about login name and encrypted password are stored both in
the CodeX database
user table and in the Linux password and group files. User IDs (uid)
are in the range (20000-49999), the uid number is determined
when
the user account is first created on the CodeX Web frontend. It's a
sequential
number incremented for each newly created account. Account ID of
deleted users
are not re-used.<br>
  <font color="#ff0000"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remark</span>:</font>
Unix login name are all
lowercase even if uppercase are used in the Web login name. <br>
&nbsp; <li> <b>A Samba account</b> again with the same login name and
password.</li>
  <br>
This account is used only when accessing the resources exported as
Windows
shared resources (more in the Samba section). Information about login
name
and encrypted password stored in the CodeX database and in the
Samba password file.
</ol>
There are specific user account you must know about:
<ul>
  <li> <b>sourceforge:</b> this is the user that owns the entire CodeX
Web
site hierarchy under /home/httpd</li>
  <li> <b>dummy:</b> a "dummy" user that is generally used whenever a
file
belongs to a given group but to no specific user in particular. More or
less
equivalent to the "nobody" user.</li>
  <li> <b>mailman:</b> owner of the mailman directories</li>
  <li> <b>anoncvs_xxxx</b>: a specific user created for each project
where xxxx is the project short name .
These are not real login account but are just used to give source code
checkout
capabilities
to anonymous users. By default CodeX does not allow anonymous CVS
access and these accounts are not used unless a project explicitely
asks for anonymous CVS access to be activated.We keep maintaining them
in case a project would like to activate
anonymous
read access on their CVS repository. uid range is 50000-65535.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Group accounts</h2>
When a CodeX hosted project is created the project administrator gives
it
a project short name. This project short name can be used in a number
of
places:
<ol>
  <li> http://codex.xerox.com/projects/<i>ProjectShortName</i> is a
shortcut
to access a project summary page on the CodeX Web site (not to be
confused
with the Project Web site at http://<i>ProjectShortName</i>.codex.xerox.com/</li>
  <br>
&nbsp; <li> A Unix group with the same name (all lowercase) is created
in
the /etc/group Unix file.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> It is applied to all projects related disk resources (e.g. the
Project
home directory where the project web site is hosted).</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> Members of this group are all the developers who are declared
as
"project members" by the project administrator in the
Project
Admin page. In other word there is a direct mapping between project
membership as
defined through the Web frontend and group membership on the Unix side.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
&nbsp;
  </ul>
  <li> A Unix group with the same name as the user login name is also
created
for each user. So by default each user is a member of a group of his
own.
These groups are used for user home directories for instance so that
only
the user can access its own home directory.</li>
</ol>
There are specific group accounts you must know about:
<ul>
  <li> <b>sourceforge:</b> group created to own the CodeX Web
hierarchy
under <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/httpd</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">mailman:</span> group owner of
all the Mailman directories (<span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/mailman</span>)</li>
</ul>
<h1> CodeX File Structure</h1>
<h2> Web site</h2>
The CodeX Web front end files are all under <b><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/home/httpd</span>.</b> Except
otherwise
specified this directories and all the files and directories under it
belongs
to user.group: <b>sourceforge.sourceforge</b> (rwxr-xr-x) <br>

and
group <i>ProjectName</i>. File permission is read only (r--r--r--) for
files and directories are user and group writable (rwxrwxr-x). This is
defined by CVS and must not be touched. <br>
      <br>
By default CVS servers on CodeX are configured to perform all
transactions through the pserver protocol. CodeX can be tuned to use
the ssh tunnelling protocol instead. Ask the Xerox CodeX team for more
information. If secured transaction and fine grain access permissions
are high on your&nbsp; list of preoject requirements, we strongly
advise you to consider the use of Subversion instead of CVS.<br>
      <p>Exceptions to these rules are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> CVS files that correspond to executables for which we want
the executable flags to be preserved when the file is checked out of
the

repo. It is world writable (drwxrwxrwx) so that all users even those
not
part of the project team can checkout a working copy of the CVS tree.</li>
        <li>The CVS repository for each project is owned by the user <i>sourceforge.</i>
This allows the CVS web interface, which implements its own access
control,
to access the directory even if the directory is not world readable.<br>
        </li>
        <li> For <u>private</u> projects the CVS repository is NOT

Ability to commit changes to the CVS repository from a working copy is
controlled
by the CVSROOT/readers and CVSROOT/writers files. Those users in the
writers file
(all project members as of today) can commit changes to the CVS
repository.&nbsp; Project administrators who wants to prevent some
project members to commit changes in the project CVS repository should
add the corresponding login names in the readers file (the writers file

<h1> <a name="CodeX_Databases"></a>CodeX Databases</h1>
<h2> The CodeX Master Database</h2>
CodeX uses the MySQL database engine to store all of the project data.
MySQL is fast, lightweight and very robust. <br>
<h3> Database Creation</h3>
The CodeX database is created once when the CodeX software is first
installed. The scripts used to create and populate the database are
located in <span style="font-family: monospace;">SF/db/mysql</span>. <br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">Remark:</font></b> NEVER EVER run this SQL
scripts
once the DB has been created or it will destroy all of your existing
data !! <br>
&nbsp;
<h3> Database Update</h3>
As you operate your own CodeX site, the CodeX team at Xerox will
provide you with a number of feature enhancements and defect
corrections that you may wan to install on your site (see the <a
 href="#CodeX_Code_Update">CodeX Code Update</a> section below). Some
of the changes may impact the database structure in which case a
database patch named dbxxxx.sql or dbxxxx.pl will appear under <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">SF/db/upgrades</span>.<br>
<br>
<h3>Database Access Permissions</h3>
MySQL has its own access permission
management
system that is completely independent from the access permission
management system of the underlying operating system . Although
we use the same user names for the MySQL and Linux administration
accounts they are actually managed separately. Although this is not
mandatory, we suggest that you use the same password on&nbsp; Linux and
MySQL for a given account.<br>
<p>The CodeX administration accounts with access to the CodeX database
are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>root</b>: This user
has
full administration right on all the MySQL databases and users. You
must use
this user whenever you want to grant/revoke new permission to a given
user
or network domain, etc...</li>
  <li> <b>sourceforge</b>: the user that was specifically created to
have
read/write access to the sourceforge database. It can only interact
with
the database from the local host and not from a remote machine. All the
CodeX PHP scripts run under this user name to
connect
to the database (see the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/codex/conf/local.inc</span>
for the configuration of the database user and password).<br>
  </li>
  <li> <b>dummy</b>: this user was created with read only access on
the CodeX
database (SELECT granted). It has no password and can only be used for
a
connection from the local host. This user is the one used by all
Project Virtual
Web site and if they include PHP scripts they can connect to the DB and
extract
information about their project as well as user/login/session
information.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">cxuser</span>: this user has
read-only access to the project databases that are created when a
project administrator create a project database export (See the <a
 href="/documentation/user_guide/html/en_US/ProjectDataExport.html">Project
Data Export</a> section in the CodeX User Guide). No password is needed
for this user.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Interacting with Databases</h2>
Whatever way you decide to use to access the CodeX databases (command
line
or phpMyAdmin), reading (part of) the MySQL documentation is a
pre-requisite.
<u>Don't forget that you are now entering the realm of the core project
data
and making any mistake here is NOT allowed or you'll probably cause
SEVERE
damages.</u>
<h3> Command Line</h3>
From any Unix account, type:
<p><tt>$ mysql -u <span style="font-style: italic;">user_name</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic;">database_name</span> -p</tt> </p>
<p>where database_name is the name of the database you want to connect
to
(e.g. "sourceforge" for the CodeX master database) and the user_name is
the MySQL user name you
pretend
to be (type -p if there is a password associated with this user but
don't
type the password in clear here to avoid having the password appearing
in
the shell command history file) </p>
<p>Then the database is yours and you can interact with it through
using SQL statements. Here are two sample SQL statements<br>
</p>
<p><tt>mysql&gt; SELECT group_name FROM groups WHERE is_public = 0; #
show a list a private project name<br>
</tt></p>
<p><tt>mysql&gt; UPDATE user SET realname='Laurent R. Julliard' WHERE
user_id
= 103; # update the full name of the user_id 103<br>
<br>
</tt> </p>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">** IMPORTANT REMARK **</font></b></p>
</center>
<font color="#ff0000">It is highly recommended that you practice a bit
on a
MySQL test database before playing with the real CodeX database.
Ideally you should
always
test a SQL statement on the CodeX test server before running it on the
production
server. Except for SELECT statements which are harmless anyway.</font>
<h3> phpMyAdmin</h3>
phpMyAdmin is a PHP based graphical User Interface to the MySQL
database.&nbsp;
It
is currently configured on the CodeX production server to give access
to
the CodeX database only. You can access phpMyAdmin at
<center>
<p>http://<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>/phpMyAdmin</p>
</center>
<p>This is password protected at the HTTP level. Authenticate with the
sourceforge
user
name and password. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>

<h1> Apache</h1>
The Apache master configuration file is in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</span>. The
master file also includes specific configuration files located at /<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">etc/httpd/conf.d</span>.&nbsp;
<h2> Master server</h2>
The master CodeX Web server can be accessed through one the following
URLs:
xww.<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>, www.<span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span> or simply <span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>. and any aliases
that you may have defined yoursefl in the file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/var/named/codex.zone</span>. The
Apache Document
Root is at <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/httpd/SF/www</span>
where all the PHP scripts are located.
<h2> Virtual Servers</h2>
Each project has its own project Web server. The config file for these
servers
is <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/codex_vhosts.conf</tt>. Each of these server
execute
under a specific User (dummy) and Group (the project group name). This
is
to
make sure that the server has enough permission to write in any storage
area
belonging to the project but cannot write to other project storage
spaces on the CodeX server. The dummy user also has
read-only access
to the CodeX database. By doing so we allow the Project Web servers to
use
PHP in their HTML pages and access session information like who is
browsing
the site, whether it is an anonymous user or not, etc.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Remark</span>:
for the User/Group directive to work in a Virtual Web server,
Apache has to go through the suexec utility delivered with Apache. This
utility
has been modified for CodeX and recompiled because the security checks
made by the original version are too restrictive to work properly in
the
CodeX environment.&nbsp; Even though these security checks have been
relaxed the suexec program is still very safe given the CodeX context. </p>
<p>The modifications are available in&nbsp; <tt>/home./httpd/SF/utils/apache_1.3.19-suexec.patch
</tt>in the form of a diff file which applies to both apache 1.3.x and
Apache 2.0.x. As a Codex customer you'll never have to apply this patch
to new version of Apache as the CodeX team at Xerox will provide with
ready to install Apache RPMs when needed.<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>
<hr width="100%"></h1>
<h1> FTP</h1>
The FTP server configuration file is in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/ftpaccess</span> and it has been
configured
to work with CodeX. The default configuration allows access to both
anonymous
users (using the "ftp" account) and to all registered users through
their
normal CodeX login/password. This can be used to edit the HTML pages of
the&nbsp; Project Web
server
pages remotely for instance with Netscape Composer, DreamWeaver,
FrontPage and many other Web editing environment<br>
<br>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h1> CVS</h1>
<h2> Using CVS on CodeX</h2>
This document is not a tutorial on CVS. For an introduction to CVS
refer
to the <a
 href="/documentation/user_guide/html/en_US/VersionControlWithCVS.html">CVS
section of the CodeX User Guide</a>.<br>
&nbsp;
<h2> CodeX specific CVS</h2>
The CVS&nbsp;RPM&nbsp;packages installed on CodeX contains a modified
version
of cvs. The reason the CVS source code has been modified is as follows:
<p>When cvs runs in client server mode (as it does on&nbsp;CodeX) the
server
must be told which directories are allowed as CVS root directories.
These are
the various places where the CVS repositories are located. Allowed CVS
repostories are given to the CVS server through the&nbsp; --allow-root=<span
 style="font-style: italic;">pathname</span> command line options where
<span style="font-style: italic;">pathname</span> is the allowed path.
This option is repeated as many times
as
the number of CVS repositories. While this way of doing is OK for a
small to mid-size CVS server it doesn't scale to hundreds or thousands
of CVS repositories because repeating&nbsp;
--allow-root options hundreds of times would exceed&nbsp; the maximum
allowed size of a Linux command line. Therefore, a new option has been
implemented in the cvs server called --allow-root-file=<span
 style="font-style: italic;">filename</span> where
<span style="font-style: italic;">filename</span> is the name of a file
containing the list of all allowed CVS
repositories on CodeX.<br>
</p>
<p>On CodeX this file is created/updated by the daemon script and
resides
in <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/cvs_root_allow</span>. <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Remark</span>:
as a CodeX customer you will automatically receive any new version of
the CodeX specific CVS RPMs and you don't have to apply any of the
patch by hand to the CodeX sources.<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2> Running the CVS server</h2>
The CVS server does not run permanently in the background. It is
launched
only when necessary through the inetd daemon that is configured to
listen on the port of the pserver protocol (tcp/2401). Look for <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/inetd.conf/cvs</span>
for
the command line used to run the cvs server.
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h1> DNS</h1>
CodeX has its own internal domain : codex.xerox.com. And the codex
machine is the name server for this domain. The DNS configuration files
are
located in:<br>
<ul>
  <li><tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>: top configuration file&nbsp;</li>
  <li><tt>/var/named/codex.zone</tt>: this is
where&nbsp;the
codex.xerox.com domain is defined.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><tt>/var/named/codex_full.zone</tt>: this
file
is automatically generated by the CodeX daemon scripts&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2> Static configuration file<br>
</h2>
<p>
The top configuration file is in <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>. This file
is static
and must be edited by hand. Before the CodeX server is installed you
must ask your network administrator to create the CodeX domain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span> and delegate the
administration of this domain to the CodeX server. </p>
<p>The static part of the CodeX zone is defined in <tt>/var/named/codex.zone</tt>
. It contains the IP address for the master CodeX server as well as a
list of aliases defined like www,&nbsp; xww,&nbsp; cvs,
download, shell,
users, lists, etc.... The reason why all these aliases have been
defined is
because as the load on the main CodeX server increases it may be
desirable
to
host some CodeX functions on a separate server (e.g the mailing list
manager or the CVS server). Doing so will just be a matter of changing
the IP address
associated
with the lists.<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>
or cvs.<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span> and
all the rest will be transparent for
the
end users. </p>
<p>Similarly mail exchange records (MX record) have been defined for
lists.<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>.
Strictly speaking this is not necessary today because the IP address of
the
machine receiving the e-mail is the same as the one
lists.<span style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>
is pointing to. But in the future we may want to have a dedicated
server to
handle email for the codex domain. Hence the MX record. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h2> Dynamic configuration file</h2>
As explained above each project on CodeX has its own Web server that
can
be accessed at the URL http://<span style="font-style: italic;">projectname</span>.<span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>. For this to
work
all these names must be declared in the CodeX DNS configuration file.
This is done by the CodeX daemon scripts. The DNS aliases are generated
in the

<p>The daemon scripts are also responsible for merging the static
configuration
file with the dynamic part of it and store in the actual configuration
that
is going to be used by the DNS server bind. This file is at <tt>/var/named/codex_full.zone</tt>
. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Remarks</span>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <tt>codex_full.zone</tt> file must never be edited by hand
!! All changes in this file will be lost next time the daemon scripts
run.</li>
  <li> When new projects are defined and aliases are activated in DNS
it
may take some time for the information to propagate to the rest of the
Xerox
network (up to a day in some cases depending on the configuration of
your company DNS servers). So if a new project owner
complains that
the URL is not yet working tell him/her to be patient ;-)<br>

<h1> SSH</h1>
The Secure Shell service is available on CodeX. All registered user
with
an active account can use it to login into CodeX in a secure way. To
make
Windows users life easier you may also activate the telnet service as
telnet comes standard with the Windows operating system. However we
highly recommend not to enable telnet for security reasons and instruct
your Windows users to install an SSH client instead.<br>
<br>
As a CodeX site administrator you may also decide to disable shell
accounts for all users. If this is so you must change the default shell
assigned to new Codex users when they register. See the <a
 href="/documentation/installation_guide/html/CodeX_Installation_Guide.html#Shell_Account">SSH
section in the CodeX installation Guide</a> for detailed instructions.<br>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">** IMPORTANT REMARK **</font></b></p>
</center>
<font color="#ff0000">For security and traceability reasons, it is
recommended that CodeX administrators <b>never</b> use
telnet
to log to the CodeX server. It is not secure and it makes critical
password
travel on the Xerox network in clear text!! The CodeX team recommends
that CodeX administrators follows the following procedure to log into
the CodeX server:</font>
<ol>
  <li> <font color="#ff0000">Connect to the CodeX server using ssh and
your
personal CodeX account (e.g. ssh <span style="font-style: italic;">username</span>@codex.xerox.com)</font></li>
  <li> <font color="#ff0000">Then if you must act as root or
sourceforge
user use the su command (su - root) and type the appropriate password</font></li>
</ol>
<font color="#ff0000">The reason for the 2-step process is to be able
to determine from the <span style="font-family: monospace;">/var/log/messages</span>

<h1> Samba</h1>
Samab allows Windows users to access a number of CodeX shared resources
(see below). The Samba password file
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/smbpasswd</span> is
generated automatically by the CodeX backend scripts like the
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/passwd</span>,
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/shadow</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/group</span> files. The
login/password used by CodeX users to access their shared resources are
the same as the CodeX login and password. When browsing the CodeX
shared resource from the Windows Explorer, users will see the following
folders<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>FTP Incoming directory</b>: make it easy to upload file
releases
for Windows users that do not have/know the command line FTP client</li>
  <li> <b>The User directory</b>: a given user will only see her own
user directory.<br>

<h1> Mailman</h1>
The Mailman mailing lists manager requires little attention from the

<h2> The scripts</h2>
It is beyond the scope of this document to review all the scripts under
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/httpd/SF/utils</span>. The
most important scripts a CodeX administrator must know about are:<br>
<p><b><u>xerox_crontab.sh</u></b> </p>
<p>This is an orchestrator script in charge of running many others in
the appropriate order. By default it runs once every other hours. Let's
review what the script does step by step: </p>
<ol>
  <li> First it dumps all the necessary information from the CodeX
database
into the <a href="#Dump_files">Dump Files</a> area. User, groups
(projects),
mailing list information, User SSH keys. Dump files are used throughout
the rest of the script.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Generate e-mail aliases for the mailing lists
(<span style="font-style: italic;">projectname</span>-xxxxx@lists.<span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>)
and for the users (<span style="font-style: italic;">username</span>@users.<span
 style="font-style: italic;">your.codex.domain</span>) and store them
in the&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/dummy/dumps/aliases</span>
file.</li>
  <li> Copy the freshly dumped file into /etc/aliases.codex and force
sendmail
aliases refresh to activate the new aliases.</li>
  <li> Runs the <span style="font-family: monospace;">utils/underworld-dummy/dns_conf.pl</span>
script to generate
the
DNS zone dump file (project web server name aliases), copy this file in
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">/var/named/codex_full.zone</span>
and restart the named daemon to propagate any new server&nbsp; names
associated with new projects.<br>
  </li>
  <li> Generate the Apache config file for virtual hosts (project Web
sites)</li>
  <li> Run <span style="font-family: monospace;">new_parse.pl</span>
to update existing user account
(creation, deletion, ,suspension)
and create the new user and group account as well as all the related
directories
(see below for more details)</li>
  <li> Restart Apache with the new Virtual host definition (done after
user/group
update)</li>
  <li> Create the appropriate SSH shared in user directories (as given
through
the Web interface)</li>
  <li> Create any new mailing list in mailman.</li>
  <li> Exit</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<b><u>new_parse.pl</u></b> </p>
<p>This script is critical in the creation of the user/group
infrastructure
and it is worth spending some time on it. Let's go through the file
step by
step: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Open the user dump file and the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
files and look for those users that have been deleted, activated,
suspended, password
or shell has changed and modify the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file
accordingly</li>
  <li> If this is a new user:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Create the user home directory with appropriate permissions in
/home/users/</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Do the same with groups (projects). Open the project dump file
and
/etc/group and see which group have been added/deleted/suspended.
Project directories are all under /home/groups.</li>
  <li> If this is a new project :</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Create the project home directory in /home/groups</li>
    <li> Create the default htdocs, cgi-bin and log Subdirectories for
the
Project Web site in the project home directory</li>
    <li> Copy the default index.php file (home page) in htdocs so that
when
you access the project Web site it displays something clever (We copy
this
default home from the master copy in SF/utils/default_page.php)</li>
    <li> Create the FTP release space and the Anonymous FTP space.</li>
    <li> Initialize a new CVS repository for this project with the "cvs
init"
command</li>
    <li> Create the .lockdir directory in the new CVS repository with
world
writable permission (see <a href="#CVS_Repositories">CVS&nbsp;Repositories
      </a>above) and change the CVSROOT/config file to tell CVS that it
must
use this as a lock directory. Commit the changes made to the config
file
with a simple rcs checkin command.</li>
    <li>Change the CVSROOT/loginfo file to make sure that
CVS&nbsp;change
all the committed files to group ownership. This is to solve the
problem if
a user belongs to several groups and the one selected by default is not
the
right one. The setuid bit on the group should probably work as well but
it
has not been tested. This method works so let's keep it.</li>
    <li> Change the user ownership of the entire CVS repo to <i>sourceforge</i>
to start with</li>
    <li> Create the anoncvs_xxxx user in case we want to activate the
anonymous
checkout access to CVS again one day. (today you must be a registered
user
to checkout&nbsp; -read- and you must be a project member to commit
changes
-write-)</li>
    <li> If it's a private project or if the CVS repo contains a <tt>.CODEX_PRIVATE</tt>
file, then make sure only the project members can look at the files in
the
CVS repo when using the shell account.</li>
    <li>If it's a private project or if the group home directory
contains
a <tt>.CODEX_PRIVATE</tt> file, then make sure that only project
members
have access to the group home directory when using the shell account.</li>
    <li> Initialize a new Subversion repository for this project and
create
the default access permission file and install the post-commit hook
script<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
The output of all the backend scripts run through xerox_crontab.sh is
sent to
the
codex-admin email alias for verification .<br>

<h1> <a name="Log_Files"></a>Log Files</h1>
<h2> Log Files</h2>
For a description of the Log files used by the CodeX server see
the
<a href="#Log_files">Log Files </a>section above. In addition to these
files
there are a number of other log files that are worth knowing: <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<table border="1" width="100%" nosave="">
  <tbody>
    <tr nosave="">
      <td style="font-family: monospace;" valign="top" nosave="">/var/log/messages</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="font-family: monospace;">/var/log/maillog</td>
      <td>This is where all the log messages related to mail activities
go. All sendmail messages for message sent and received are stored in
this file.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h2> Log file rotation</h2>
Linux has the ability to automatically rotate the log files to prevent
them
from growing indefinitely. The logrotate utility is ran everyday at
23:58pm
(EST time) as defined in <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/crontab</span>.
Note that this is different from
the
crontab file of the root user that is used to run the CodeX daemon
scripts.
<p>The logrotate configuration files located in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/logrotate.d/apache</span>
and&nbsp;
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/logrotate.d/ftp</span> have
been customized for CodeX.
The customization consists in the execution of a post rotation script
that
makes a daily copy of the log files in the CodeX log files area as
described in
the
<a href="#Log_files">Log Files </a>section.<br>

<h1><a name="CodeX_Code_Update"></a>CodeX Code Update</h1>
<p><b><font size="+3"></font></b><br>
CodeX offers a continuous update process to CodeX site administrators
to quickly and easily put in place new bug fixes, new features while
minimizing the server downtime. The CodeX software is made of PHP and
Perl code that is delivered in source form to our customers. The CodeX
software resides in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">/home/httpd</span>
directory and it is formatted in such a way that it behaves like a CVS
working copy that can be remotely updated when ever the system
administrator decide to do so.<br>
<br>
As a CodeX customer you will be entitled to receive the CodeX CVS
events by email. They are reports about the defect that have been
solved and the new feature that have been implemented in CodeX.
Benefiting from these new features is just a matter of update your
CodeX working copy. Here is how you should proceed:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First you should obtain the pointer to the CodeX source code
repository that you must use for your updates. This pointer is called
the <span style="font-style: italic;">CVS Root</span> and is different
depending whether&nbsp; you operate a CodeX site on the Xerox Intranet
or on your own customer network :</li>

<ul>
  <li>Log to the 'sourceforge' CodeX shell account on the CodeX server</li>
  <li>Go to the CodeX top directory: <span

  <li>Setup the CVSROOT environment variable with the appropriate value

  <li>At that stage you must carefully review the file list and look if
the file SF/etc/local.inc.dist or&nbsp; SF/db/upgrades/dbxxxx.sql
are mentioned in the list. If this is so go to the next step. If not
then it 's a normal update operation that you can do with a simple:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">cvs -q up -Pd<br>

    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If <span style="font-family: monospace;">SF/etc/local.inc.dist</span>

<p>There are two different types of backups that run on CodeX.&nbsp;
First, MySQL data is backed up to disk using the linux "dump"
command.&nbsp; And finally, all disk partitions are backed up to tape
using Legato software.
</p>

backed up to disk.&nbsp; The sequence is as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql stop</li>
    <li> move old codex-bin.index, codex-bin.001, sqldump.&lt;last

<h1> CodeX Testing Environment</h1>
The CodeX source code has been modified so that multiple instances of
the
CodeX software ca run on the same physical machine. The goal here is to
allow
each developer in the CodeX Team to have his/her own source tree
available
for modification and testing and avoid any interference with other
developers.<br>
<br>
The setting of a developer's testing environment is fully document in
the
CodeX Configuration Management Plan.<br>
