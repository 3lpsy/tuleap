All the zone files used by SourceForge are in this directory.
However Codex does not use them. Here is where the file are:
- aliases.zone : on CodeX it is /etc/aliases and all the
   dynaimically generated aliases are in /etc/aliases.codex
- sendmail.cw.zone : is not used because there is no per 
   project MX records like on SourceForge
- dns.zone : the equivalent is in /usr/local/domain/data/primary/codex.zone and the complete DNS config file for the CodeX is generated in /usr/local/domain/data/primary/codex_full.zone
- httpd.conf.zone : the file is in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and includes the file /etc/httpd/conf/codex_vhosts.conf which is generated automatically.
