The CodeX software developed and maintained internally by the Xerox
CodeX Team derives from the SourceForge software version 2.0. There is
no official installation guide for CodeX. However you can use the
following documents to help you install the Software.

- SourceForge Installation Guide (http://zoy.org/~guillaum/SF/)
- CodeX Administration Guide (http://codex.codex.xerox.com/documents/CodeX_Administration_Guide.html)
- CodeX User Guide (http://codex.codex.xerox.com/documents/CUG_color.pdf)

Also see the README file for more information.

		      **** IMPORTANT REMARK ****

Before installing another instance of the CodeX software in Xerox we
strongly suggest you contact the CodeX Team at codex-contact@codex.xerox.com.

We are interested in learning more about your needs, why you choose
not to use the official CodeX site. We also want to make sure that
Xerox software developers throughout the corporation still have a
global view of what are the on-going software projects in Xerox even
if you fork another site.
