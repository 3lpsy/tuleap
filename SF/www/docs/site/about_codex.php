<h2>About the CodeX Site</h2>

<P>Codex is a service to
<B>all Xerox software development team</B>s who want to <b>internally</B> share the source code of their software projects with other Xerox development teams. CodeX aims at transposing inside the Xerox Corporate environment, the software development culture and methods that have proven to be efficient in the external Open Source world.<p>

To make things very clear and to avoid any confusion, CodeX is not about making Xerox software Open Source outside of Xerox. CodeX is about Inner Source: it means that all the projects hosted on the CodeX site are for <u>Xerox internal use and sharing only</u>.<P>

The CodeX team wants to make internal source code sharing easy and to provide a single place where to go to when you as a developer, a project leader or a manager are looking for existing pieces of software and/or technology that you could re-use, adapt and improve to speed up your own Time To Market while capitalizing on Xerox knowledge. For a consistent and fruitful approach of internal software sharing, the CodeX Team has put together the <b><A href="/docman/display_doc.php?docid=16&group_id=1">Xerox Code eXchange Policy</a></b>. It governs internal code sharing and re-use and is the cornerstone of the CodeX edifice. Make sure you <A href="/docs/licenses/xrx.php">read it</a>. <P>

CodeX also offers a full-featured, purely web-based and easy to use project management and communication environment. Avoid the recurrent burden of setting up a project management environment in your own team. Using CodeX can help you save time/money and better focus on what really matters: software development and users/developers relationship.

A more in-depth discussion of CodeX benefits and business value to Xerox is available in the document entitled "The Xerox Code eXchange Project" available on the <a href="http://bazaar.adoc.xerox.com/xerox/resources.html">Xerox Open Source Web site</a>.<P>

We strongly invite you to read this document to better understand where Xerox is today in terms of source code sharing and where we want it to be in the near future. If you want to help convert Xerox to a more open and spontaneous internal code sharing culture then spread the word about CodeX and publish your projects on the CodeX site.<P>

We thank you for your support!<P>

The <a href="/staff.php">CodeX team</a>.
