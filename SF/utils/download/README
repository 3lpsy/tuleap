Describe how stats scripts works and where input come from and where output goes.

stats_ftp_logparse.pl
---------------------
Parse daily log files of the FTP daemon (they are in /home/log)
Input: ftp daemon daily log file
Output: stats_ftp_downloads table

stats_http_logparse.pl
---------------------
Parse daily log files of the HTTP daemon (they are in /home/log)
Input: http daemon daily log file
Output: stats_http_downloads table

stats_agr_filerelease.pl
------------------------
Aggregates the HTTP and FTP downloads of Codex released file and generate the total number of downloads by group (project) for all times (frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg) and by file release for all times as well (frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg)
Input: stats_http_downloads, stats_ftp_downloads tables
Output: frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg, frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg tables

stats_nightly_filerelease.pl
----------------------------
Aggregates the HTTP and FTP downloads of Codex released file and generate the total number of downloads per day by group (project) (frs_dlstats_group_agg) and by file release per day as well (frs_dlstats_file_agg)
Input: stats_http_downloads, stats_ftp_downloads tables
Output:  frs_dlstats_group_agg, frs_dlstats_file_agg tables


db_dlstats_grouptotal.pl
------------------------
Sum downloads by group and by day and aggregate them into the global table. It is somehow similar to stats_agr_filerelease.pl combined with stats_nightly_filerelease.pl but the input is from other DB tables. It should give exactly the same result.
Input:  frs_dlstats_group_agg table
Output: frs_dlstats_grouptotal_agg table

db_dlstats_filetotal.pl
-----------------------
Same as above but this time it counts the number of downloads by CodeX released file. SAm observation as above
Input:  frs_dlstats_file_agg table
Output: frs_dlstats_filetotal_agg table

db_dlstats_allagg.pl
-----------------------
Rescan all HTTP log files from the log dir (/home/log) and recompute the total number of HTTP downloads for each file release and for each day
Input: HTTP log files
Output: frs_dlstats_agg

db_dlstats_grp.pl
-----------------
Recompute the number of downloads of released file for all days from the frs_dlstats_agg and store it into frs_dlstats_group_agg. It is equivalent to stats_nightly_filerelease.pl but it does it for all log file at once. It is a way of regenerating
Input: frs_dlstats_agg
Output: frs_dlstats_group_agg
