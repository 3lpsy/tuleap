This tool aims to fix "missing files" in FRS after upgrade to 6.9

A bug (request #5808) was introduced in 6.9 and fixed (request #6338) in 6.11.
This bug move references to files without actually moving the files themselves,
hence people get "File not found" in FRS for valid files.

This script will re-associate files and DB entries properly.
