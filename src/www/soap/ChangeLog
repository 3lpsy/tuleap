4.1 - (Codendi_ST 4.0.16) Not released yet
	What Changed?
	============
	Types
	-----
	* FRSFile Type as 3 new fields:
	  computed_md5 	MD5 checksum computed on server side by Codendi
	  reference_md5 MD5 checksum submitted by user when releasing the file (if any)
	  user_id 	Id of user who made the delivery

	Methods
	-------
	* addFile has a new parameter (last position):
	  reference_md5 MD5 of the file you submit. If not blank, it will be compared to the value computed on the server and if values differ, an error will be raised.

	* addUploadedFile has a new parameter (last position):
	  reference_md5 MD5 of the file you submit. If not blank, it will be compared to the value computed on the server and if values differ, an error will be raised.

	* getFile no longer returns deleted files.
	
	What's new ?
	============
	Methods
	-------
	* getFileInfo
	  tns:FRSFile getFileInfo(xsd:string sessionKey, xsd:int group_id, xsd:int package_id, xsd:int release_id, xsd:int file_id)
	    Returns the metadata of the file contained in
	    The release release_id in the package package_id, in the project group_id.
	    Returns a soap fault if the group ID does not match with a valid project, or if the package ID
	    does not match with the right group ID, or if the release ID does not match with the right package ID,
	    or if the file ID does not match with the right release ID.
	
	* getFileChunk
	  xsd:string getFileChunk(xsd:string sessionKey, xsd:int group_id, xsd:int package_id, xsd:int release_id, xsd:int file_id, xsd:int offset, xsd:int size)
	    Returns a part (chunk) of the <strong>content</strong>, encoded in base64, of the file contained in
	    the release release_id in the package package_id, in the project group_id.
	    You specify the offset where the download should start and the size to transfer.
	    Returns a soap fault if the group ID does not match with a valid project, or if the package ID
	    does not match with the right group ID, or if the release ID does not match with the right package ID,
	    or if the file ID does not match with the right release ID.'

	* addFileChunk
	  xsd:integer addFileChunk(xsd:string sessionKey, xsd:string filename, xsd:string contents, xsd:boolean first_chunk)
	    Add a chunk to a file in the incoming directory to be released later in FRS.
	    The content of the chunk must be encoded in base64.
	    Returns the size of the written chunk if the chunk addition succeed.
	    Returns a soap fault if the session is not valid
	    or if the addition failed.'

	Bug fix
	=======
	* addFilePackage set the default permissions properly (ie. package readable by registered_user)
	* addFileRelease now inherits package's permissions (bug #codex:113853)
