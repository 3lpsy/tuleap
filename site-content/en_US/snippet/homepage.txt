	The purpose of this archive is to let you share your code snippets with the rest of Xerox. Code snippets are small pieces of code like scripts, macros, 
	and functions that does not require a full project environment to be put in place.
	<P>
	You can create a new code snippet, then post additional versions of that 
	snippet quickly and easily.
	<P>
	Once you have code snippets posted, you can also group code snippets together by creating a "Package" of snippets. 
	That package can contain multiple, specific versions of individual code snippets.
