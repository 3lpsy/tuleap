<H2>Step 1: <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Services & Requirements (Service Specific Rules)</H2>

<p>
We are now offering a full suite of services for <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> projects. If
you haven't already, please be sure to browse the most recent revision of
the <a href="/docs/site" target="side_window"><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Services</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use of Project Account</b>
</p>

<p>
The space given to you on this server is given for the expressed purpose of
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> software development or, in the case of web sites, the advancement of software sharing and reuse 
 culture inside <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?>. For more information, please read the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Terms of Service ("Terms of Service") in Step 2.
</p>


<p>
<b><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Link</b>
</p>

<p>
If you host a web site at <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>, you must place one of our approved
graphic images on your site with a link back to <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>. The graphic may
either link to the main <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> site or to your project page on
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>. We will leave placement up to you.  For information about how
to insert a <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> logo which will track your pageviews, please read
the <a href="/documentation/user_guide/html/en_US/ReferencingtheCodeXSite.html" target="side_window"><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Logo display documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Code eXchange Policy</b>
</p>

<p>
In the course of the registration process you will be presented with the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Code eXchange Policy. This policy has been patiently crafted by the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team and the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Legal Department. It explains the rights and duties implied by code sharing. We strongly suggest that you use this default policy for your own project. Do not confuse this policy with Copyright:  in any case your team (and <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> in general) will still own the code and the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> standard Copyright statement must be present in your source code.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to use another policy that is not currently approved by the
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team, let us know and we will review these requests on a
case-by-case basis. But please be sure that the one we provide is not good enough before you contact us.
</p>

<p>
It is our intent to provide a permanent home for all versions of your code.
We do reserve the right, however, to terminate your project if there is due
cause, in accordance with the Terms of Service.
