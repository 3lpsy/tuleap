<H2>Step 5: Software Policy</H2>



<P><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> was created to promote code
sharing of <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> internally developed software and to have one single
place where to shop for pieces of source code.

<p>To keep things simple, the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team and the
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Legal Department have put together a default <a
href="/docman/display_doc.php?docid=16&group_id=1" target="side_window"><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Code eXchange
Policy</a> that defines the terms and conditions under which source
code can be shared inside <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?>.

<P>We think that this policy serves well the purpose of code sharing
while offering a good level of protection. However if this default
policy doesn't fit your needs select the item "Other" in the menu
below and let us know why you wish to use another policy. Your new
policy will be reviewed by the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Legal Department and the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team for approval.

<P>Choosing a new policy is a serious decision. Please take some time
to read the <a href="/docman/display_doc.php?docid=16&group_id=1"
target="side_window">default <?php echo $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Corporate Policy</a> before making a choice about
your project. <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> is not responsible
for legal discrepencies regarding your own software policy.

<P>
Two important remarks:
<ul>

<li>If you are applying for a website hosting-only project and do not
expect to host any source code (why ? :-) on <?php print
$GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>, please select "website-only" from the
choices below and proceed.</LI>

<LI>If your software has already been approved by the COMIP for
external Open Source then choose the Open Source license that covers
your <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> software. It will help other project teams to decide whether they
can/want to re-use your code in there own <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> owned software.</li>

</UL>
