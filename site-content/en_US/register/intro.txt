<H2><?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Project Registration
<?php print help_button('CreatingANewProject.html') ?></H2>

<p>
The <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team would like to extend an invitation to any 
<?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> Software project to be hosted on the <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> site. 
</p>

<p><B>The Process</B>

<P>Registering a project with <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> is an easy process, but we do require
some information in order to automate things as much as possible. The entire
process should take about 5 to 10 minutes.

<P>During signup, we will present you with some legal documents 
regarding your account with us. Please do not
ignore these; they are very important to you and your project.
