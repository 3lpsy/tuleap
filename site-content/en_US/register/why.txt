The <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> Team would like to extend an invitation to any internally developed project  to be hosted on <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?>. Our goal is to promote collaborative software development and project management at <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Why are we doing this ?</i><br>
A lot of internal projects are being hosted all over the place in <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> and not only is it difficult to know who is working on what but it also implies that each development team is re-creating the same kind of development environment again and again. In addition, by offering a unique and full featured infrastructure, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> brings simplicity, efficiency, security and cost savings to <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> project teams.
</p>

<p>
<i>What we provide:</i>
<li>Fully configurable project environment
<li>Version control systems (CVS, Subversion...)
<li>Universal and highly flexible trackers (tasks, bugs, support requests...)
<li>File release space with access control
<li>Global administration of access permissions
<li>E-mail Lists and Web Forums (Public & Private)
<li>News publishing
<li>Project Web site
<li>Subdomain hosting -- i.e., yourproject.<?php echo $sys_default_domain; ?>
<li>Project data export (reporting)
<li>Usage statistics
<li>Access audit trail
<li>Restricted Shell Access (optional)             
</p>                           
           
<p>
<li>Account acceptance is at our discretion and is based on the following criteria:
<ul>
<li><i>relevance</i>: <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> internally developed sofware projects only, 
<li><i>legitimacy</i>: your project must have a goal aligned with <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']; ?> business,
<li><i>appropriateness</i>: hosted projects must provide source code or documentation).
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, <?php print $GLOBALS['sys_name']; ?> reserves the
right to revoke an existing account without notice if there is due
cause.
