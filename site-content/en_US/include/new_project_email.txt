Please take some time to read the site documentation about the tools
and services offered by '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' to project
administrators. Most of the documentation (including a detailed User
Guide) is available under the "Site documentation" link on the left
hand side menu of the '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' Home page.

We now invite you to visit the Public Summary page of your project at
http://'.$GLOBALS['sys_default_domain'].'/projects/'.$row_grp['unix_group_name'].',
create a short public description for your project and categorize it
in the Software Map. This will be immensely helpful to the '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' visitors.

Once on your Project Summary Page you will see a "Project Admin" link
on the left hand side. This Admin. page allows you to fully
administrate your project environment you can create create mailing
lists, forums, manage your tasks, bugs,etc.  and why not publish your
first project news to advertise its creation (we\'ll put it on the
front page !).

Other miscellaneous points:

- Your Shell account will become active at the next
'.$GLOBALS['sys_crondelay'].'-hour cron update.  If after
'.$GLOBALS['sys_crondelay'].' hours your shell account or your CVS
access still does not work, please open a support ticket so that we
may take a look at the problem.

- Also note that it might take up to a day for the '. $GLOBALS['sys_org_name']. ' name servers
to be aware of your project specific server names (see above). If you
are in a hurry, you may try shelling into
'. $GLOBALS['sys_shell_host']. ' and pointing your CVS client to
'. $GLOBALS['sys_cvs_host'].'.

- Your web site hosting area (Project Web Server) is accessible
through your shell account, ftp or as Windows shared resource.(See the
'.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' User Guide for more details).

- A side comment on CVS: if you already have a CVS repository of your
own and want to transfer it as is on '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' then
contact us. We\'ll need a tar/gzip or zipped file of your entire
document root, including the top CVSROOT directory.  This will
preserve your revision history. If you do not care about preserving
the existing CVS history then just do a "cvs import" yourself.

Enjoy the system, and please tell other '.$GLOBALS['sys_org_name'].' employees about
'.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].'.  The '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' Team believes
in the value of code sharing inside '.$GLOBALS['sys_org_name'].' and we rely on all of you to
preach the word. Let\'s grow the '.$GLOBALS['sys_org_name'].' Source Code Sharing community !

Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you.

 -- The '.$GLOBALS['sys_name'].' Team';
