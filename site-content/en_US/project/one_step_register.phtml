<h2>Choose an appropriate template for your project.</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
    A project template is a pre-configured workspace: activated tools (trackers, version control system, communication tools...) 
    tools customisation and configuration (workflow, documentation structure...), user groups, permissions, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    The project template you will select provides some services. Add those you need and/ or desactivate those you will not use.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can always modify your project workspace after your project has been approved.
</p>

<h2>That's it!</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
    You are about to request the actual project creation. 
    You will receive a notification when the sytem administrator has validated it.
    Then, you will be able to access your new project workspace. Enjoy!
